### Ready-to-use template for new projects using Vite, React, Typescript and Jest
<br />
<br />

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

Setting up Jest with Vite and Typescript can be tricky and time-consuming - I made this template to be able to set up my own new repos and projects quickly. I used a combination of resources to put this together, linked below - some of these resources are partially out-of-date, or needed customizing to work. The interaction between and development of these projects (Vite and Jest, etc) is constantly evolving, so refer to these links with that in mind and expect that over time, adjustments to this repo will likely be needed.

<br />
<br />

## Acknowledgments

Special appreciation to Manny, who wrote [this excellent Medium article](https://codingwithmanny.medium.com/quick-jest-setup-with-vitejs-react-typescript-82f325e4323f) in 2021 showing the errors you will encounter doing this from scratch, why they occur, and how to solve them. A bit out of date now (sorry Manny!) but was still super helpful and thorough.
